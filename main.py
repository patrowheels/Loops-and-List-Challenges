# Challenge #1: Iterate through every number in a list to separate out even and odd numbers. Identify possible outlier values as well.


# Challenge #2: Find the sum of all numbers in a list


# Challenge 3: Calculate the sum of even numbers in a list


# challenge 4: Print the following pattern
# 1 
# 1 2 
# 1 2 3 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 1 2 3 4 5


# challenge 5: Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number of my_list


# challenge 6: Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number


# Exercise 7: Display numbers from a list using loop


# Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions:
# -The number must be divisible by five
# -If the number is lesser than 10, then skip it and move to the next number
# -If the number is greater than 60, then stop the loop



# Exercise 8: Print the following pattern
# Write a program to use for loop to print the following reverse number pattern

# 5 4 3 2 1 
# 4 3 2 1 
# 3 2 1 
# 2 1 
# 1



# Exercise 9: Print list in reverse order using a loop
# Given:

# list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Expected output:
# 50
# 40
# 30
# 20
# 10



# Exercise 10: Reverse a given integer number
# Given:
# 76542

# Expected output:

# 24567




# Exercise 11: Use else block to display a message “Done” after successful execution of for loop
# Expected output:

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Done!
